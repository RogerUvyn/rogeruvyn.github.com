<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This is a test website used by it's designer, Roger Uvyn. It is my sandbox as we call it. It's a place for me to try new code so if you see words not spelled correctly or something that look crazy it could be because it is still a work in progress and I maybe in the process of changing code and fixing or breaking things.</p>

<h2>Currently Working On</h2>
<p>What am I currently working on? The answer is responsive design. So if you see things here that may not make sense to you donâ€™t stress out. Remember this is my area to play and experiment so you may see different combinations of buttons code and crazy things. Just remember they all have a purpose in the grand scheme of the universe.</p>
