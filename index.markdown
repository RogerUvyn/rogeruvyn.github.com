<h2>Welcome To My Sandbox</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to my world. This site is what we programmers call my sandbox. A sandbox is an isolated computing environment used by software developers to test new programming code. I use this for development and testing of new code. So beware there could be great code here and well maybe just maybe some not so great code. Feel free to look around and see what I am doing from time to time.</p>

<h4>Currently Working On</h4>
<p>What am I currently working on? The answer is could be anything. So if you see things here that may not make sense to you donâ€™t stress out. Remember this is my area to play and experiment so you may see different combinations of buttons code and crazy things. You also have to understand you may not see anything because I maybe working on thing that are here but there are no links to the code. So if you don't see it here it doesn't mean I am not working on it, it just means you can't see it. Just remember they all have a purpose in the grand scheme of the universe.</p>
