### What drive's you crazy?
####Retired People out at lnch time.
#####Why is it retired people always wait to go out when the workign world is trying to fit as much as they can into a one hour lunch time? It seems to me they always wait and then go out from 12:00-1:00 and drive 15 miles under the speed limit, then get in the front of the line and do every thing possible to make a 1 minute check out turn into a 20 minute check out.
