### Responsive Web Design
#####Currently I am working on research of responsive web design using several tools such as but not limited to bootstrap, jekyll, HTML 5.0, and several others. As I stated on the homepage of this site this site is my sandbox and there will be great and bad things you may see here. Remember I may leave work and not get something working so the site could have a really nasty look sometimes. Don't judge unless you want to get in and fix it.
